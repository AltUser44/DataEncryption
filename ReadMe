This program is a RSA Encryption application, written with Python with a user-friendly graphical interface
that enables users to perform RSA encryption and decryption of text messages.
Uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI and the `pycryptodome` library
for cryptographic operations, the tool automatically generates RSA keys upon
initialization and provides users with straightforward functionalities to encrypt
plain text and decrypt ciphertext. The encryption result is presented in hexadecimal format,
this application offers an intuitive way for users to interact and understand fundamental concepts of RSA encryption.
